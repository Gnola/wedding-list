[WeddingList](https://weddingguestlist.herokuapp.com/)

## Approach
Planning a wedding is tough enough as it is so I wanted to create a website that allowed the admins (those planning the wedding) to have an interactive site that they can use to keep track of things such as guests and their info, what their RSVP is, who was sent an invitation and what services are paid for or not. Utilizing a website like this gives you an advantage to keep all information needed in one location rather than scattered among various other apps. As an additional feature guests are able to access their information and change it to keep it up to date as they see fit. This allows for less work on the end of the bride and groom.

## About
This wedding planning website allows you to view your guestlist depending on their RSVP and/or whether or not you have sent them an invitation. There is also a budget page that deciphers whether or not you have paid for a service needed at the wedding. As a guest you are able to access and edit your information such as RSVP, email and address.


This app was build using:

HTML

CSS

Javascript

Node.js

Express

Mongo / MongoDB / Mongo Atlas


## Navigating the app
From the homepage you are able to log in as an admin or search for yourself as a guest. When logging in as an admin you are able to view all the pages (rsvps, invites and budget) and manipulate the data however you need to. Depending on the info of the guest the lists will update accordingly. If you search for yourself as a guest you are only able to view and edit your information and are unaware of any other aspects of the website.
